# Why Is Naming Things Hard?

A good name is a chunk that encodes important information about what
the thing does. As we are doing this abstraction from a precise to an 
ambiguous language, many times it seems not satisfactory.

## Generating best practices
* Make functions do one thing
* Keep functions small
* Avoid meaningless names
* Avoid too abstract names. Be specific during communication.
* Be consistent

The first two points is just the basic principle of clean code, while
 the later ones is exactly what we do when writing papers.
 
## Disrupting best practices
Inconsistency can serve as remind for the reader.

## Precision with words
Hard. Manually rename those things when their functionality changes.
 For those names that is used in things like thrift, a precise name 
 in the beginning helps, or else it will be a disaster.
