1. Mistake #1: Measuring Approximations of Output
Note: 上有政策下有对策，engineer很聪明的。自己写个BUG，给自己开个BUG，再自己修了，妥妥的KPI达标了。另一个副作用就如文中所说，engineer的日常就会从完成工作变成KPI达标。

2. Mistake #2: Not Measuring Anything
Note: politics over productivity. 会玩政治可以不劳而获，真正有OUTPUT很可能会离开TEAM。

Solution:Measure Blockers at the Team Level 
"Starting with Microsoft in the '80s, tech companies gave engineers free resources (like food and gyms) that would remove blockers to their work."
MICROSFT DOESNT PROVIDE FREE FOOD!!!!

engineer input and blockers
总结一下的话我觉得可以归纳为
1. resources
2. environment

对应的blockers
1. Not enough efficient ES support or tools
2. too many politics, 血汗工厂， 996 etc.

"
What is preventing the engineers from building faster?
What issues are arising in real time?  
What technology or process investments would increase team engagement?
"
说的挺好的

"If your team is full of competent, driven engineers, removing their blockers is the fastest way to enable forward movement."
我老板和我1ON1的时候跟我提起过，她的top priority就是帮助我们remove all the blockers。

why team level
"Engineers also hate being micromanaged, so tracking individual activity can make them feel untrusted."
"win and lose together"

Engineering effectiveness in 3 parts
1. Measuring the experience of engineering teams in their most frequent activities.  
2. Using the results of those measurements to quantitatively improve the developer experience.
3. The final result will take care of itself.

我觉得这篇文章有点意思的地方是从另一个角度看问题，通常我们都是想着how to improve and how to do better，但这里是what blocks us。
