## 成为管理者的感受
[what-becoming-an-engineering-manager-is-like](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-becoming-an-engineering-manager-is-like/)
- > It feels lonely.
- > The other day, you had your team, and you were one of them. The next, you're the manager. You now have an invisible wall between you and them. They're no longer the group you can share all your problems with. You can't just speak your mind without thinking. People act different when you crack that exact same joke you did in the past.

成为管理者的最大感受是孤独，在开发者的时候，拥有团队，拥有小伙伴，成为管理者之后，你变得有些特别，无论在团队成员眼中，还是实际你所承担的职责本身。

## 成为管理者的路上所学
[Things I've learned transitioning from engineer to engineering manager](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/things-ive-learned-transitioning-from-engineer-to-engineering-manager/)

- Mentors matter - especially within the company
- Understand the most important priorities of your new role
    - > As an engineering manager, you'll need to put company first, team second and your team members third. As an individual contributor I was used to this being the other way around: I would do my job first, then help my teammates whenever I could. Only after getting these out of the way would I look for doing things that would further help the team. I didn't have to think too much of what’s good for the company - I usually assumed that whatever I’m doing is what the business needs.
    - 作为一个管理者，作者认为，公司>团队>成员。这个观点是我读本篇文章收获最大的一个地方，作为管理者，虽然你很孤独，虽然你也想回到过去，你面对最高优先级的事情是如何向公司去负责，如何去完成公司交付的职责，之后才是你的团队，你的成员，最后的最后才是你自己。
    - > As an engineering manager if I mix up the order I could easily find myself with an amazing team building something that doesn't move the needle any way. Or worse, with a group of empowered individuals each going off their own way, and not producing much valuable as a whole.
    - 而如果作为管理者，顺序搞错了，会非常糟糕，简单说就是无法成事。
- Decide on a time and task management strategy
- Set short term goals
- Finally - take time to read, experiment, learn and reflect

- > The most visible change in moving to management is you get a lot less feedback. When you're an engineer, you get feedback on your code, on your design documents, or how your projects are going. As a manager, you have none of this. There are also often no clear and specific expectations of what you should be doing in this role。
    - 成为技术管理者之后，你最大的变化是你很难得到反馈，进而成就感、获得感非常的少。
- [checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qH2AiF6aw4myLsni9v9SEqB-QB2gdumLFbYgXKdiDQ/edit)
    - **Team building and teaching** : Build trust on the team, execute on hiring (if they have headcount), and develop people on their team.
    - **Deliver results**: Ensure the team has a structure to execute on, get things done, and keep a high quality bar.
    - **Collaborate and connect**: Keep an open communications channel with the team, connect people and teams, and run good meetings.
    - **Vision**: Ensure the team has a purpose and collect team values. Involve the team in planning for what the team will do.
    - **Professional growth**: Keep growing as a person: set their own goals, work with a mentor, network with peers and give back.
- 作者的几个观点
   - **不要照搬清单**：My advice in using this checklist is this: don't blindly copy it: but customize it.
   - **关注管理者的结果，而不是具体做法**Try not to define exactly how the engineering manager should go about doing something. 
   - **让管理者成长最杠杆率最高的事情**As a manager to a first-time engineering manager, investing your time to help these managers succeed is one of the highest leverage activities you can do.
