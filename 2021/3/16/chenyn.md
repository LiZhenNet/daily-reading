- stakeholders = stake-holders🌝
- neglect proper communication because:
    - "important" is very often steamrolled by "urgent"
    - architecture has subtle complexities which get lost
- architects should make balance on: (or there will be antipatterns, clichees)
    - **external**: listenning, researching, driving
    - **internal**: decisioning, validating, documenting
- three working modes:
    - **inwards**: listenning, reading, asking, for info and knowledge
    - **processing**: (literaly) thinking and processing those info, diving into them
    - **outwards**: presentating, documenting and continuous supporting, to spread new infos
        - both inwards and outwards works ensure your ideas against being **fractional**, **obsolete**, **impractical** and thus **ignored**.
- things can help:
    - **asynchronous communication** scales better: you can quote, record
        - writing and diagramming is essential skills
        - keep blogging and recording decisions
    - **regular newsletter**: initiate things I've been recently working-on
        - ideas come across over time, people sometimes learn from something weeks ago
    - **concrete explaination**
        - rarely talk architect overview, use concrete concepts to make ideas comprehensible
            - "Abstractions are the luxury of the expert"
        - according to [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/): **simplify** provides better explaination. Also see <https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/m_pdAJGU3pz27CZGV7uYHw>
        - don't forget background - to solve a problem, so close the circle to the solution
