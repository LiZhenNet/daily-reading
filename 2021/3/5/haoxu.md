1. your manager can’t know every detail about your job
Notes: No micro management! And it's impossible for managers to know the details.

2. they might not know: what’s slowing the team down
Note: it's your responsibility to let managers know how they can help to resolve the blocking issues. It's managers' job to clear those obstacles.

Solution:
what you can do to help: tell them what’s hard about your job
Note: same as #2, it's OK to make mistakes and ask for help. Nobody is superman and our job is to get the work done, with all the necessary resources. And your manager is the person to get those resources ready.

3. they might not know: exactly what individual people on the team are working on
Note: same as #1. It's OK to now know the details, but manager needs to know who knows the details.

4. they might not know: where the technical debt is
Note: depends on the types of managers. Some managers are from IC and they are really good at tech, but most managers are doing people management and might have little tech background.

Solution
what you can do to help: tell them about technical risks!
Note: Translate tech details to languages that everyone can understand. I always believe it's a good skill to simplify complicated concepts.

5. they might not know: how to help you get better at your job
Note: I think this is 50/50. It depends on if the team member knows what he/she is good at or interested in. Managers can help to provide resources and push the team member if necessary for career growth.

Solution:
what you can do to help: identify what you need and ask for it!
Note: One big lesson I learnt a few years ago is that, ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANT. I used to believe as long as you are an excellment team member, your manager will recognize it and promote you. But this is not the case, my current manager told me (at that time, she was not my manager yet), ask for WAHT YOU WANT, otherwise, your manager will think, YOU ARE FINE WITH WHAT YOU HAVE.

And do reguar syncup 1on1 with managers, exchange feedbacks, understand your manager's expectation for you and your manager's goal as well.

Conclusion and other notes:
It really depends on your relationship with your manager. My manager and I are good friends in life and she gave me tons of useful and practical suggestions on career development, which is really good but also, on the other hand, makes me feel guilty to leave my current team for better opportunities outside.
