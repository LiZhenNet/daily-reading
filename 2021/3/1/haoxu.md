"Without understanding it completely,

"set up $7 Cloud Billing budget" 

So author is already very careful about this experiment.

"As our account had not made any payment thus far, GCP should’ve first made charge for $100 as per billing info, and on non-payment, stopped the services. But it didn’t. I understood the reason later, but it’s still not the user’s fault!"

This seems to be the expected behavior by default.
