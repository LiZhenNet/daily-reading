Framework
1. Page an Incident Commander:
IC is paged (what if noise?) and decides if this incident worths investigation. What is the role of the Sylvester S. guy in the scrrenshot?

2. Move to a dedicated chat room:
Start a bridge

3. Update public status site:
post comms

4. Send out internal Situation Report:
IC tracks the situation of the incident, and update it regularly.

5. Assess problem 
Note: should this be part of #1? If the severity is low, maybe it doesnt even worth a brdige or comms?

6. Mitigate problem:
Mitigation if possible. 
Q: without engaging engineering team, how could the response team know any possible mitigation? via dev notes?

7. Coordinate response:
who decides transfer of incidents? I guess both IC can make the decision but the feature team needs to provide information to prove the ownership.

8. Manage ongoing response:
IC summarize the incidents.

9. Post-incident cleanup:
10. Post-incident follow-up:
Servide review, post-mortem

Thoughts
这个framework对IC的要求还挺高的，既要对整个service和ownership有很好的理解，又要能有很好的communication，不仅仅是对内，还有对customer。
好奇：Heroku发生过什么SEV0的incident。
