## Simple vs. easy
* The roots of "simple" mean "one twist" -> no interleaving, not cardinality.
 It's objective.
* The latin origin of "easy" is the root of "adjacent" -> near at hand,
familiar. Subjective.

## Why simplicity matters in software development
* Simple -> understandable -> simple to maintain
* Easy strategy moves fast at the beginning, but the complexity 
will ruin the project
* Be aware of incidental complexity

## Making Things Easy
* Bring to hand by installing
* Become familiar by learning
* Simplify things. Mentally limited as human.
* Complect: don't do it!
* Compose: to place simple things together, great -> Modularity
* State is never simple

## How to build simple systems
* Abstracting is not about complexity hiding
* Abstracting: answer questions related to what, who, when, where, why and how
* I don't know -> I don't want to know
