# 读书笔记

## 主要内容
作者开头是一个引子，十四五岁时候的一些幻想，写在一个笔记本上，十年后，无意中发现，当初的幻想几成现实。
> As I read through it, I discovered that 90% of the statements I had made in that description were true (or true in spirit).

作者讲了关于'bodypainting'的故事，从最初觉得incredibly complex, technical and inscrutable，直到可以参加顶级比赛。
再到遇到一个高手Sanatan Dinda，虽然作者与其都是这方面的高手，但是Sanatan Dinda在作者看来就像是另外一个世界，他的一些做法是如此的难以理解又如此的让人震撼。
> Even though he placed first and I placed fifth and logically we both existed on a scale of ‘competence at bodypainting’ it seemed like the skills required were completely different. You could not simply scale up my abilities and get Sanatan’s.

> If you asked me to imitate the work of any of the top 20 bodypainters, I could give you a fair imitation, given enough time and access to reference images. With his work I have no idea.

> I look at those pieces now and could replicate any of them, but at the time they seemed incredibly complex, technical and inscrutable – I couldn’t break down what steps the artist might have taken or why. I just saw them as unattainable.

想有特别大的成长和变化，这个需要一个基础性的改变，如何看世界。
> The way to extraordinary growth and changes often involves a fundamental ontological or ‘lens’ shift in how you see the world. Magicians are wearing not just better, but fundamentally differently shaped lenses to the rest of us.


作者列举了一些问题，通过问这些问题，可以找到<魔法> 
- ‘What is the most capable version of me that I can imagine?’
- ‘What would I be like/spend my time doing if all my current major problems had been solved?’
- ‘What are the things I say I value but don’t act as if I value, and what would my life feel like on inside if I actually acted as if I valued those things?’
- ‘What am I afraid of doing, and what would my life be like if I wasn’t afraid of doing those things?’.


一直紧盯目标和结果，在某种意义上反而会使得目标更远。
> You can’t keep your gaze tightly fixed on the outcome you want because it will lock your mind onto the strategies you currently have for meeting them, which by definition probably don’t work (otherwise you would have succeeded already and you wouldn’t need to use the strategy).

想拥有<魔法>，成为<魔术师>，要在魔术师旁边待着，想像你是他们中间的一员。
> So, in short, a helpful strategy for becoming a magician: Surround yourself with people who look like magicians to you. Then imagine yourself as one, older and wiser, in great detail. Imagine yourself as the person you would be afraid to say you want to be out loud to others (because it seems so ridiculously impossible right now). Write it down in great clarity and detail, then forget it. And let the part of your subconscious mind that still remembers lead you to becoming the things you want, and maybe, years later, check if it did.

## 个人总结
如下这段话，我挺有感触的一段话，想有质的飞跃，纯粹靠量的积累可能是远远不够的，需要一些基础性的改变，包括如何看待世界、如何看待你所从事的工作。另外就是还是要有大大的梦想，并且不断的去想从想像这个梦想，跟已经实现或者在接近实现这个梦想的人不断的交流和学习，开放一些。
