> When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." 

> There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you.

生命短暂，小孩子都知道的事情，真切的体会到这个事实，因人而异，如作者一样，大多人会在有了孩子，成为父母的时候有更确切的感受，生命确实确实太短暂了。我有孩子，我有时候会想起他们小的时候（虽然现在也不大），三岁版本的样子，只存在于记忆中，存在于照片和视频中了。

生命如果只是短暂，倒还好，但是生活和工作中却冲突了bullshit，有两种来源，一种是别人强压给你的，一种是你被诱惑了。

生命短暂，无论从哪个角度来讲都应该做点让自己觉得厉害的事情，做点有意义的事情，所以需要对抗bullshit，别人强压给你的，你被无形中诱惑的。

> There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic. This could become more common.

> If you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.

> If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income.

> You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed, the law of supply and demand insures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it

你需要赚钱，而赚钱就得承受一些被强压的事情。【the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it】这段话没太看懂，这句话的反面大概是说，你接受强压的事情越来越多，并不意味着你能赚越来越多的钱，反而浪费了生命。

需要一些改变，从挑选公司，挑战客户等等维度，以及尽可能少的做那些无意义的事情，比如无意义的开会等等。

> As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them.

> For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in.

> One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.

在消除一些无意义的事情之后，是找到重要的事情，那些matters。首先，在要在乎别人怎么看你，这个不只是对于中学生，对于成年人也是这样，甚至有些人一生都是这样，脸皮要厚一些。什么事情是重要的，不是从现在看，要从未来看，未来如果你还在乎，那么就是重要的，就是你要找的matters. 那些让你发怒的，那么急迫的事情，那些消耗时间的玩意儿（比如抖音）在未来的角度来看，完完全全是bullshit.


> If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. 

> You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. 

> The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. 

> Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

生命是短暂的，这种短暂会给你带来很多"惊喜"。对那么重要的事情，那些matters，不要等待，立刻去做，否则窗口会关上，就算长时间窗口不会关上，窗口也最终会关上。


> I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both make sense here.

> How you live affects how long you live.

> It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it. Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.

> It's easy to let the days rush by. The "flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms.

对于一些东西，如果数量是有限的，有两种方法，一种是得到更多，一种是好好的利用已有的，这句话对于生命适用，对于其它场景也适用。
慢下来，即便忙成鬼，也要学会偷得浮生半日闲。

> Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have.

这是本文的最后一段话，期望自己未来能够这样。
