# I've conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io. Here are 5 common problem areas I've see

面试侧重点：
  1. 技术的专业度
  2. 解决问题的能力：如何分解问题？如何解决问题？
  3. 沟通能力
  
Common Problem Areas I See in Interviews：
 - 过早进入编码阶段而缺少深度思考：5 minutes thinking through high-level design choices, 5 minutes to plan and prove the mid-level design, and then get to work on code.
 - Communicating "Half-thoughts"
 - Not asking clarifying questions
 - Assuming your interviewer sets all the rules： Spend the first few minutes of the interview setting expectations, especially around communication and work process.
 - Not asking for help sooner
