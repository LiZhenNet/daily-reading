Common Problem Area 1: Jumping into code too soon
well, this happens a lot but the interviewers would probably stop it before the interviewees jumps too fast because if they dont have a whole picture of what the interviewees are going to do, it would be difficult for them to write interview feedback. They would guide the interviewees to talk about the mid-level design first, unless it's a algorithem question. But always, it would perfect for the interviewees to start this pattern, which would leave them a good impression.

Common Problem Area 2: Communicating “Half-thoughts”
Let the interviewers know what you are talking about, even if you decide not to go that approach.

Common Problem Area 3: Not asking clarifying questions
This would help to avoid pitfalls and edge cases. The interviewer clearly knows the corner cases, and if the interviewee doesnt ask for clarification, they would use those to challenge them in testing. 

Common Problem Area 4: Assuming your interviewer sets all the rules
Well, my experience is interviewer tends to let interviewee do whatever they want and then comment later. The kind of chat mentioned in this article actually would be an amazing experence for the interviewer since most of them are not expecting it. And it also shows the interviewee is a good communicator.

Common Problem Area 5: Not asking for help sooner
It's OK to say I dont know or I need some hints instead of wasting time on something you cannot resolve right away.
