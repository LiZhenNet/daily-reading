### 50%+
The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
 - <10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.
 - 10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises.
 - 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.
 
50%+的精力放在一个事情上，会产生极高的效率。核心是要找到这个重要的事情，然后再有策略能够focus 50%+的精力。
如果找到要事是另外一个话题，本文讲了如何聚焦50%+的精力。
- CARE VISCERALLY
- MONOTASK
- EVADE OBLIGATIONS
- TIMEBOX BULLSHIT

### CARE VISCERALLY
> To be reliably able to focus on something, you need to be intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome.

### MONOTASK
一次只做一件事！这个很难绝对达到，但是要进努力进入这样的状态，一次只做一件事情！
> As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.

### EVADE OBLIGATIONS
> I can only have one obligation to other people

> During Management Attempt #1, my programming project distracted me so much because other people cared a lot that I finished it—if I ever had to de-prioritize it, I would make those people sad. This made it take up my attention (by worrying about letting people down) even when I wasn’t working on it. Unfortunately, since management work comes in urgent bursts, I’d often end up in a situation where I had to delay either the programming or the management—i.e., choose between making two different sets of people sad—and in those cases it was very hard for me to control my focus.

同一时间对外只承担一项义务或者责任。在作者描述的第一段经历中（Management Attempt #1），同时被各种人拉扯，隐形的承担了很多责任。作为管理者，一定要把"猴子"下放给别人来喂，责任一定要共担，否则，最后的下场就是作者描述的下场。

### TIMEBOX BULLSHIT
- 琐事开辟时间单独处理。 “bullshit timebox”—a one-hour period a few times a week
- 坚持原则，在没有处理琐事的时候不被琐事所扰。 During the remaining 165 hours per week, I do my resolute best not to think about any of the bullshit, no matter how much people bug me
- 事情开始做，就要做结束（比如能电话能当面就不要发N条消息），不然要不断的'开始'去做，浪费更多的精力。 I try to minimize my number of “open loops”—projects or processes that I’ve started but not completed.
