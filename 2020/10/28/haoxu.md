1. Transitionary, ephemeral software
NCDP benefits from easy prototyping, would be good for just demo purpose.
Q: how ofen could that happen???

2. High-churn code
For code which could be repalced very soon. NCDP provides convenience.
Q: I feel most of the cases that NCDP would be a good option are where the stakeholders dont know what they want or are still figuring what exactly is needed.

3. Avoiding the same mistakes
good point, NCDP = reifying workflows. I could be similiar to automations like Power Apps. NCDP brings conveniences like quick turn around, and fast demo. However, I dont think it could replace traditional programming. TBH, they are totally 2 different things and targeting different audiences. Or maybe something in the middle, mixing NCDP plus some customized tranditional programming (e.g. resuing some existing libraries while you can still code yourself) could benefit both?
